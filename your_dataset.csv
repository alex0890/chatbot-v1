Terminating unused resources,Immediate cost savings,None,"Monitor resource utilization, terminate unused or underutilized resources"
Savings Plans,"Predictable and significant cost savings, flexible payment options",No on-demand or spot instance discounts,"Select an appropriate savings plan based on expected usage, commit to a consistent amount of usage over a specified period of time"
Rightsizing,"Increased cost savings, improved application performance",None,"Regularly monitor resource utilization, adjust instance types or sizes based on actual usage"
Scheduling,Cost savings through reducing or stopping usage during off-peak periods,Limited flexibility,Use PCS Scheduler
Reserved Instances,"Significant cost savings, ability to reserve capacity",Limited flexibility,"Assess expected usage, purchase appropriate number of reserved instances for the required period of time"
S3 Intelligent Tiering,"Automated cost savings, ability to access infrequently used data",No ability to control object retrieval fees,"Enable S3 Intelligent Tiering on relevant S3 buckets, monitor usage and costs regularly"
Delete unused IP addresses,Immediate cost savings,None,Regularly review and release unused IP addresses
Migrating from GP2 to GP3,"Improved performance, reduced costs","Complexity of data migration, limited to certain workloads","Assess current usage, identify GP2 volumes that can be migrated to GP3, plan and execute the migration process"
Spot Instances,Significant cost savings for flexible workloads,"Interruptions possible, limited predictability of instance availability","Assess workloads suitable for spot instances, configure resources to use spot instances, monitor for interruptions and adjust accordingly"
