      "Here's an example of rightsizing: Suppose you have an application that receives a moderate amount of traffic during the day, but experiences spikes in traffic during peak hours. You initially deployed an EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) instance with 4 vCPUs (virtual CPUs) and 16 GB of RAM, as you anticipated high traffic demands. However, you noticed that the EC2 instance was only utilizing around 40% of its capacity during peak hours. In this scenario, you could right-size your EC2 instance to a more cost-effective instance type that meets your performance requirements while reducing costs."

Savings Plans provide a more flexible discount, as they apply automatically to usage, regardless of the instance type, size, or operating system, whereas Reservations require you to choose the specific instance types and availability zones that the discount will apply to."
